Hello and welcome to this blog. 

This is blog is about tracking and building my own knowledge management system.

## DAY 1 Getting start
Read the [bloging tips](https://www.fast.ai/) form fastai.

Learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [YAML syntaxand] (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) , and their [cheat sheet](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/markdown-yaml-cheat-sheet/#yaml).


I also found a wonderful project [100-Days-Of-ML-Code](https://github.com/MLEveryday/100-Days-Of-ML-Code) as a great blogging example.
